# A. Background

Nonprofit organizations in the Waterloo region often have a social media presence, especially on Twitter. 

We would like to analyze the data surrounding their accounts to help these nonprofit organizations grow their online presence, engagement, and ultimately help the communities they serve (for e.g. by raising awareness for their respective causes). 

The DFG "Social Media Study" series consists of multiple meetups conducted over the next few months that will analyze Twitter data for the above goal. 

# B. Today's event
Today is the first event of the series, where we introduce the audience to some social media mining tools & techniques that they can use / build on to analyze nonprofit's Twitter data. 

This will be an interactive tutorial event. The audience will do as the instructor does. We will pause for questions at suitable times as well as answer them via chat. Please ensure you can access this Github link to the tutorial data & code.

The techniques we will teach include:
<ol>scraping Twitter timeline data 
common text cleaning methods 
common text EDA 
topic modeling
